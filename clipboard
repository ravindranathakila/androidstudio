Simple tips on becoming a good software developer 
=================================================

* Use the right tools. This will make a huge difference from saving years worth of time and keep you from feeling miserable, sad and depressed. Always remember, it's just a tool. 
* Use shortcuts. Start with keyboard shortcuts. Later, find tools to automate your work. Finally, adopt an Automation lifestyle. 
* Use "assume" instead of action verbs and create a daily to-do lists. Instead of writing "Code the search bar", write "Assume the search bar". It's as if though an emperor was saying, "Let's assume control of this city". Keep the list doable within the day. The word assume is used to encourage forming a belief around the task being already accomplished. Imagining the to-do list being done before starting work on it, will make a huge difference. 
* Always assume there's a better solution than what has been chosen, whether it was by you or someone else. 
* Know that assuming imperfection will make what you build more sustainable, hence closer to perfection with time.
