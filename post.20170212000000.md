## Opening the gates to a true search (engine)

GATES, AND OR NOT, are used to communicate logic using High and Low (Binary) format.

These days search engines be like: So you say search "Baby meets dog"? Okay I look for websites that got it, and sort them by some decisions based off inbound link count to that page or a different criteria.

Do you know Yoda from Star Wars? (I'm sorry I had to ask). If you ask Yoda, 

"Tell me where I can find baby meets dog", his reply would not be a sorted list of websites. 

Yoda might be like,

"Meets not dog the baby, meets but two happy minds and joyful they be".

Can you build your search engine to provide Wisdom? At least, can you do it like: 

You: "Where can I eat burgers around here"

Search Engine: "You eat a lot of burgers don't you? Maybe some healthy food? Here's the list of burger outlets. But here's where you can get healthy food, on top".
