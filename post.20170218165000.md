Thinking Tech 
================

* Do all your team members know which components of the tech infrastructure cost most? 
* Does your tech require a lot of configuration? Does this truly drive industry barriers to entry or is it just a stone in your shoe? 
* How hard is it to transfer any tech knowledge any team member has to someone new? 
* Are you planning your tech stack for failure and recovery right from the beginning? 
* Are you building your business strategy around your tech stack? 
* Are you using human resources instead of tools when they can be actually used?
