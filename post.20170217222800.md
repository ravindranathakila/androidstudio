Thinking Big Data Storage 
=====================

How much data do you have? 
How often do you need to access the data? 
How often do you need to modify the data? 
How granular accessed do you want your data to be? 

The CAP Theorem 
Which one of the following are you open to losing in terms of storage access and modification of your data: Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance? 

The ACID requirements 
Is your data transactional? 

Is your database sparse? 

Do you plan to aggregate data? Would you like to have OLAP?
