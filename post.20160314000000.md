On Carrot and Stick Mentality 
==============================

According to Wikipedia,  "carrot and stick" approach is an idiom that refers to a policy of offering a combination of rewards and punishment to induce behavior. It is named in reference to a cart driver dangling a carrot in front of a mule and holding a stick behind it. The mule would move towards the carrot because it wants the reward of food, while also moving away from the stick behind it, since it does not want the punishment of pain, thus drawing the cart.

I happen to read Daniel Pink's book on motivation According to Daniel H Pink one could be motivated with a more profound framework than enslave oneself to a carrot-and-stick governance. He states the following three critical necessities to be effectively motivated. (Bear in mind that you can control many of these aspects)

Autonomy - Obtained via autonomy over Task, Team, Time and Technology
Mastery - Realization that it is Incremental, Asymptotic and Painful.
Purpose - Finding a true purpose that would not waver despite setbacks.
I have found following this framework very effective with some teams I have worked with.
