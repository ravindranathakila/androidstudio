Should I commit? 
================ 

As a developer, if your wife or partner thinks you have commitment issues, don't take it to your heart. I'm sure she has seen plenty of your searches in your browser history: 

* should I commit .gitignore 
* should I commit node_modues 

She might even think you're trying to cheat on her with these people. 

Well, to commit or not commit, isn't that the question!
