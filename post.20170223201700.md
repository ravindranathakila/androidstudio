Can you code in Singlish? 

I believe Singlish is very efficient in simple communication, so I thought it would make a good programming language. Let's see ;)

Sing++ 
------ 
```
scanf - LAI 
if - HAVE 
else if - ALSO HAVE 
else - DONT HAVE 
end of block - LA 
switch - HOW 
case - CAN 
default - CANNOT
while - ALREADY 
ternary ? - CAN 
ternary : - ORNOT 
```

Lessons1.sing 
------------- 
```

LAI something // prompt 
(user input "money")

HAVE something IS "money" 
 PRINT "happy"
ALSO HAVE something IS "house" 
 PRINT "very happy"
ALSO HAVE something IS "car" 
 PRINT "also happy"
DONT HAVE 
 PRINT "not so happy"
LA 

LAI finish 
(user input empty)

HOW finish
 CAN "early": PRINT "go home"
 CAN "never": PRINT "stay office"
 CANNOT: PRINT "die"
LA

LAI time 
(user input 1)

ALREADY ( time < 5)
 PRINT "work"
 X = X+1 
LA 

today = work CAN "go office" ORNOT "mc" 

```

Note 1: Sri Lankans use Singlish to call Sinhala + Enlgish, but here that isn't the context! 

Note 2: To be taken with a good sense of humour only.
