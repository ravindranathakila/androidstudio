Watermarks in Streaming 
========================

Have you thought about visualizing streaming in terms of watermarks? Maybe yes, but let's see if we can make it more interesting.

Imagine you were a traffic light before a junction. Now you want to time how much vehicles you let in every now and then.

So here are some points to ponder..

* Would you over burden the junction you are feeding into, if you let too many vehicles in? Would that in turn burden you if the junction gets clogged?

* Would you make drivers impatient by holding them off too long?

* Between a red to green, how much time does it take before the traffic moving speed reaches optimal flow rate (say 60 km/h), and what is the impact on the effectively movement count of vehicles per hour as you have more frequent red to green transitions as opposed to having continuously green on or fewer transitions. Does that mean you running green for ten minutes and holding off for another thirty (for the 3 other roads at the junction) is better than breaking circuit every two minute? How impatient would the that make the drivers?

* How do more frequent circuit breaks in traffic affect the journey of a driver with a short journey than that of a long journey?

Now, what are some parameters you would measure to optimize your decision? How can you define watermarks with these in mind?
