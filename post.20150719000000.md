The Sell 
========

One of the characters I admire most is Frederik Eklund. He's the #1 Real Estate Broker in New York... This is an excerpt of the forward of his book The Sell...

People want to do business with someone they like 
Selling is nothing more about playing up the good and playing down the bad 
Every successful person knows how to fail well 
Everybody wants what everybody wants
The most successful people believe their success is only temporary 
~ Barbara Corcoran, Founder of the Corcoran Group... In the book "The Sell"
