On Artificial Intelligence 
==========================

There is much hype about what AI might be capable of doing. Movies and TV serie has done a fairly through job in setting our expectations high. But as an engineer looking at the problem, I can't but help notice one flaw on the whole "expectation" front.

Let's start with a simple question. See if you can answer this: "Who is really intelligent?"

You can throw high IQ people at that. Fine. Most of the IQ questions probably could be answered by machines. Maybe not questions related to Emotional Intelligence, but if one uses imagination to infer emotion, then a computer can do permutations like anyone.

Now let's expand the question. This about this: "What is natural intelligence?"

If you think about it, our intelligence is a rolling machine. It's not artificial or natural. It's stupid at best. It's causal. It's due to cause. If you now look at bugs machines make, it's no different from those miserable expectations your mind comes up with like being Incredible Hulk. We don't call that a bug. We call it a pipe dream. 

A computer throws bugs at us. If you look long enough at a bug or failure it will throw wisdom at you. Google Slashdot effect if you doubt that and look what the industry did with that problem.

So the final question for you is: "Is anything you think original?"

Likely it's a "Why not" thought, or a mistake like most scientists did. Then computer bugs are no different.

You are better off teaching your AI imagination. And imagination comes from daring. Daring is inherent in erring and vice versa.
