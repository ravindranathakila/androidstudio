It was your idea after 
======================

One of the key traits a manager could have is the ability to have a team member believe the given idea in implementation is his.

Once he believes an idea is his the process of moulding it is far more simpler than shoving it down his throat like bitter meds. Unfortunately, ego is the main culprit that get's in the way of this and that is a hard thing to get rid of.

An easy way to do is get to the beginning of the idea (basics) and keep asking him questions starting there. Eventually he'll get to the evolved idea as a whole and believe in it. Well, a manager would have to conceal the fact that he knew the answers already (again, ego is the enemy).

Next question is, can anybody really have original ideas anyway? Aren't we just deriving from someone else's wisdom most of the time? So having someone adopt an idea of yours as their own isn't your idea if you think about it.
